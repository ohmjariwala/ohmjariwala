- Hi, I’m Ohm Jariwala, a Quantitative Finance student at Stevens Institute of Technology!

- I’m interested in mathematical theory and learning more about Quantitative Trading and Quantitative Research.
  
- I’m currently learning Python, Java, and RStudio. More specifically, I'm looking to use these languages to build quantitative models and analyze financial data more efficiently. In the future, I also aim to utilize these languages, along with others, to build models for sports projections and learn how to use code to make more efficient markets
  
- If you have any questions about my code or if you would like to connect, please reach out by email: ohmjariwala@gmail.com

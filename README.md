- Hi, I’m Ohm Jariwala, a Quantitative Finance student at Stevens Institute of Technology!

- I’m interested in mathematical theory and learning more about Quantitative Trading and Quantitative Research.
  
- I’m currently learning Python, Java, C++, and RStudio. More specifically, I'm looking to use these languages to build quantitative models and analyze financial data more efficiently.
  
- If you have any questions about my code or if you would like to connect, please reach out by email: ohmjariwala@gmail.com
